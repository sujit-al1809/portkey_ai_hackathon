# 🎯 Cost-Quality Optimization System
## 🏆 Track 4: Historical Replay & Trade-off Analysis

**Portkey AI Builders Challenge - Production-Ready AI System** 🚀

---

## 💡 What This System Does

This is a **production-grade AI optimization system** that:

1. 🔄 **Replays historical prompts** across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
2. ⚖️ **Uses LLM-as-judge** to evaluate response quality
3. 📊 **Analyzes cost-quality trade-offs** and recommends optimal model switches
4. ♾️ **Runs continuously** to monitor and optimize your AI infrastructure
5. 🧠 **Provides explainable recommendations** with confidence scores

### 💰 Real-World Impact

> 💬 "Switching from Model A to Model B reduces cost by 42% with a 6% quality impact."

This is exactly what enterprises need to make informed decisions about their AI infrastructure. ✨

### 📥
### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your Portkey API key
export PORTKEY_API_KEY="your-portkey-api-key"
```
🔑 Configure Model Catalog in Portkey

1. 🌐 Go to [Portkey Dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai)
2. 🔌 Navigate to "Integrations" and connect providers
3. ➕ Add your API keys for providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
4. ✏️ Update [config.py](config.py) with your model names

### ▶️
### Run Demo

```bash
# Run single optimization cycle

## 📊 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Historical Replay

```python
# Replays each prompt across all configured models
prompts = [
    PromptData(
        id="prompt_001",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt"}],
        original_model="GPT-4o-mini"
    )
]

results = replay_engine.replay_prompt_across_models(prompt)
# Returns: CompletionResult for each model
```

### 2️⃣ Quality Evaluation (LLM-as-Judge)

```python
# Uses GPT-4o-mini to evaluate response quality
quality_score = evaluator.evaluate(prompt, completion)
# Returns: QualityScore with:
#   - overall_score (0-100)
#   - dimension_scores (accuracy, helpfulness, clarity, completeness)
#   - reasoning
#   - confidence
```

### 3️⃣ Cost-Quality Analysis

```python
# Analyzes trade-offs and generates recommendations
recommendation = optimizer.recommend_optimization(
    current_model="GPT-4o-mini",
    all_evaluations=evaluations
)
# Returns: OptimizationRecommendation with:
#   - cost_reduction_percent
#   - quality_impact_percent
#   - confidence_score
#   - detailed reasoning
```

### 4️⃣ Continuous Monitoring

```python
# Runs continuously, processing new prompts
monitor = ContinuousMonitor()
monitor.start_continuous_monitoring()
# - Checks for new prompts every 5 minutes
# - Processes them through the pipeline
# - Updates recommendations
# - Persists state
```
